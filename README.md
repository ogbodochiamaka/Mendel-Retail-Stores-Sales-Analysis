## Introduction
This is an Excel project on sales analysis of **Mendell Sales Stores**. 
The project to analyze sales performance across time, branches, products, and customer segments, in order to evaluate profitability, identify growth opportunities, reduce product returns, and support strategic business decisions.
## Problem statements
1. How are our total revenue, expenses, and profit trending over different time periods?
2. Which branches, products, and categories are generating the highest profits?
3. What does our month-over-month and year-over-year profit growth look like, and are there any noticeable patterns or concerns?
4. How many orders are we receiving over time, and what are our return rates? What do these figures suggest about customer satisfaction?
5. Who are our customers in terms of demographics, and how can we use this information to improve our marketing and sales strategies?

## Analysis
### How are our total revenue, expenses, and profit trending over different time periods?
- Total revenue: ₦29,357,978
- Total Expenses: ₦17,277,380
- Total Profit: ₦12,080,598
- The profit percentage is 41%, indicating healthy profitability.
- Monthly comparison: This Month’s Revenue: ₦1,899,607 & Previous Month’s Revenue: ₦1,910,564 showing a slight decrease.
#### Profit trends:o	Month-over-Month (MoM)
-  Profit increases steadily from January to June, dips from July to September, then rises sharply again toward December.
#### Year-over-Year (YoY)
- Profit increased consistently from 2016 to 2018, but YoY growth has declined, signaling a possible plateau or slowdown in growth.
#### Key Insight
- While profit has increased overall, the recent drop in YoY growth may suggest market saturation, operational inefficiencies, or emerging competition.
  
### Which branches, products, and categories are generating the highest profits?
#### Top 5 Branches by Profit:
- Ibadan: ₦6,459,327
- Surulere: ₦2,208,506
- Lekki, Ikoyi, and Gbagada follow in that order.
#### Top 5 Products by Profit:
- Mountain-200 Black, 46 units: ₦626,622
- Followed closely by other variations of Mountain-200 bikes.
#### Top Categories by Profit:
- Road Bikes: ₦5,537,014
- Mountain Bikes: ₦4,513,624
- These two dominate overall profit.
#### Key Insight:
Ibadan is the top-performing branch; Mountain-200 bikes and Road/Mountain bikes are the most profitable products and categories—valuable for inventory and sales prioritization.

### What does our month-over-month and year-over-year profit growth look like, and are there any noticeable patterns or concerns?
- MoM Trend: Steady profit growth until June, followed by a mid-year dip, and a strong recovery starting October.
- YOY Trend: Profit rose from ₦1M (2016) to over ₦4M (2018), but YoY growth is now declining.
#### Concern:
Despite strong initail growth, the decline in YoY growth (as visualized by the downward trend line) suggests slowing momentum that needs attention and this is possibly showing a decline in market expansion or internal inefficiencies.

### How many orders are we receiving over time, and what are our return rates? What do these figures suggest about customer satisfaction?
- Total Orders: 27,658
- This Month Orders: 2,011
- Previous Month Orders: 1,888 → indicating a slight increase
- Returns: 60,397
- Return Rate: 3%
- This Month Returns: 156
- Previous Month Returns: 145 → indicating a slight increase
### Reasons for Returns:
- Not meeting expectations: 39.58%
- Wrong product: 27.92%
- Delays: 16.69%
- Defective products: 15.81%
#### Key Insight:
Return rate is relatively low (3%), but nearly 40% of returns are due to unmet expectations, and over a quarter due to wrong products. This may reflect gaps in customer communication or product descriptions, indicating areas to improve customer satisfaction.

### Who are our customers in terms of demographics, and how can we use this information to improve our marketing and sales strategies?
- Total Customers: 18,484
- Customer Gender Split: Female: 50.48% & Male: 49.52%
#### Key Insight:
The customer base is almost equally split between male and female, indicating an opportunity to tailor marketing campaigns equally to both demographics. For example, gender-inclusive branding and product positioning could boost engagement and loyalty.

## Recommendations:
- #### Reduce Return Rate:
Investigate and improve product descriptions and images. Implement pre-purchase Q&A, customer reviews, and clear size/spec guidance.
- #### Boost Underperforming Branches:
Analyze Gbagada’s customer footfall, stock availability, and marketing strategies. Consider local promotions, staff training, or rebranding.
- #### Reignite YOY Growth:
Launch new products, enter untapped markets, or increase online presence to drive new revenue streams.
- #### Diversify Product Portfolio:
Encourage upselling and bundling strategies for underperforming categories like Helmets and Tires & Tubes.
- #### Capitalize on High-Profit Categories:
Promote Road Bikes and Mountain Bikes more aggressively through email campaigns, social media, or discount offers.
- #### Implement Customer Segmentation Strategy:
Since gender-based contribution is balanced, segment marketing campaigns by behavior, location, and category interest rather than just gender.
